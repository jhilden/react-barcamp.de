      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        A primary goal of the React Barcamp Cologne is to be inclusive to the
        largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse
        backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly,
        safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
        orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or
        lack thereof).
      </p>
      <p>
        This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
        participate in our community, as well as the consequences for
        unacceptable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite all those who participate in React Barcamp Cologne activities
        to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Open Source & Culture Citizenship</h2>
      <p>
        A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source
        and culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and
        strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on
        our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
        is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of
        power that exist in society.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community
        is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to
        the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Expected Behavior</h2>

        </li>
        <li>
          Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the
          public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

      <h2>5. Weapons Policy</h2>
      <p>
        No weapons will be allowed at the React Barcamp Cologne or in other
        spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but
        are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large
        knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other
        item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone
        seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave
        immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.
        Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws
        on this matter.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and
        those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
        immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we
        may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary
        ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and
        without refund in the case of a paid event).
      </p>
      <h2>7. Reporting Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
        other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible directly or
        emailing info@kitconcept.de
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, community organizers are available to help community
        members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
        experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of
        in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the
        person experiencing distress.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Addressing Grievances</h2>
      <p>
        Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a
        decision of the working group, contact the React Barcamp Organisational
        Team at info@kitconcept.de with your appeal and the Team will review the
        case.
      </p>
      <h2>9. Scope</h2>
      <p>
        We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise;
        sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all
        community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one
        communications pertaining to community business.
      </p>
      <p>
        This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to
        unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community
        activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the
        safety and well-being of community members.
